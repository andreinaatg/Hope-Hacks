            <h2>Impact of Air Pollution</h2>
            <p>
              Air pollution has far-reaching consequences on human health, ecosystems, and the economy. 
              It contributes to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and even premature deaths. Environmental impacts include acid rain, smog formation, and climate change acceleration. Economically, 
              air pollution leads to healthcare costs and productivity losses. Addressing air quality is crucial for sustainable development and public health.
